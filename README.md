##Title of the Project
The Legals – Legal Firm Management Software
##Description
The Legals is a comprehensive Legal Case Management System designed to streamline the
operations of a legal firm. It enables efficient handling of cases, clients, tasks, and
documentation. Developed using Blazor Server for the frontend and ASP.NET 8 for the backend,
the system offers role-based access to three types of users: Admin, Lawyer, and Client. The
system ensures a secure, modern interface for managing legal data and interactions.
##Goals/Objectives
 Provide a centralized platform for legal firms to manage cases, hearings, documents,
invoices, and client communications.
 Offer role-based access control to streamline operations for Admins, Lawyers, and
Clients.
 Enhance transparency, reduce manual effort, and digitize the legal workflow.
 Implement secure, scalable, and responsive web technology for modern legal practices.
Technologies Used
 Frontend: Blazor Server
 Backend: ASP.NET 8, RESTful APIs
 Database: Microsoft SQL Server, Entity Framework Core
 Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
 API Documentation: Swagger
2. Problem Statement
Legal firms traditionally rely on paper records and manual communication to manage cases,
clients, and hearings. This method is prone to errors, delays, and inefficiencies, especially in
managing deadlines, documents, and financial records. Without a centralized system,
coordination between lawyers, clients, and administrators becomes fragmented and timeconsuming.
3. Proposed Solution
The Legals offers a digital solution by integrating all legal management activities into a single,
robust web platform. With distinct access roles and user-friendly interfaces, it allows users to
manage and track cases, upload and access legal documents, handle client billing, and monitor
legal proceedings in real-time. Role-based dashboards ensure that each user sees the information
relevant to their responsibilities, thereby improving productivity, accountability, and client
satisfaction.
